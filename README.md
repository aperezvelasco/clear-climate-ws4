# ClearClimate - Workshop 4

## XAI models for climate prediction, impact assessment, and decision support

This workshop (WS4) will introduce participants to the fundamentals of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and its relevance to climate science. It will begin with a primer on XAI, highlighting why transparency, interpretability, and trust are critical when using AI in scientific and decision-making contexts. A focused literature review will showcase how XAI has been applied in climate-related research, offering insight into current practices and identifying key challenges. Through hands-on exercises, participants will train a basic deep learning model for spatial downscaling and apply simple XAI techniques such as saliency maps and SHAP to interpret the modelâ€™s outputs. The interactive session will provide an opportunity to explore how these tools can enhance understanding and confidence in AI-driven climate applications. The workshop will close with an open discussion to reflect on insights gained and outline next steps for the upcoming activities.
